1. git diff :To see changes done (saved)
2. git checkout -b branch-name  :To make a branch and get into it
3. git checkout master :To again get into main branch
4. git log :To get info about all branches
5. git pull: To update the repo
6. 

7. ls :To know what's in the folder
8. mkdir foldername :To make folder

10. press q untill cursor is seen :After given git command after "git log" command and bash is stuck
11. cd .. :To go to main dir

Note: If a branch is made and pushed for raising PR then we always have to go to github to push the changes from that branch to main.

Note: To push from branch: git push origin branchname

*1. To update the local repo as remote(forked) repo:  git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
             Eg- git pull origin main

---------------------------------------------------------
1. To revert all changes in a file: git checkout -- <filename>
Eg- git checkout -- styles.css

* Note: For 'git pull' command: Suppose you have a repo in your local system which is 1 commit behind the original repo on GitHub then you add a new file abc.txt) and then you apply git pull command in this repo then it will only fetch the commit from original to local repo, it "won't delete the abc.txt file to update your local repo as original repo"

If you want to make local repo same as original repo then best method is to clone the original repo.


----------------------------------------------------------------
git push --set-upstream origin main: Sets the upstream for the main branch and pushes it for the first time.

git push: Pushes changes to the remote branch that is already set as the upstream branch.

git push -u -f origin master: Forcefully pushes changes to the master branch and sets it as the upstream branch (use with caution).
